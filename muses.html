<h3> The realization I finally had </h3>
 
<p>  I make a lot of excuses, and I'm not sure if this is common but I shy away from things that are hard. It took me discarding most physical relationships with the opposite sex, drinking, friendships, family, responsibilities and anything that wasn’t related to work, soccer or my dogs to realize that I’m the biggest reason I keep failing.  I kept blaming other things instead of realizing that I was avoiding what I was having trouble with, and that’s that I have a lot of trouble finishing things when they get hard.  I get aggravated and frustrated at myself and wonder if my time is better spent elsewhere.  So I’d sleep, have sex, lift, anything but look at the problem.  I’m 24 now and I’m not satisfied with where I am so I keep searching for why I am where I am, and while it might seem obvious that  I’m at fault for what happens I kept deflecting the truth and not doing a lot about it.  I don’t do enough to get out of the rut I’m in.  I always think of plans and then I never finish any of the projects I start. I had great plans for this website and instead like most things I’ve done I started with a lot of conviction and then once it got complicated I let it go.   I want to blame pressure, but If I can’t perform under pressure why will anyone who does important work want to hire me?  Who would want to hire someone who continually shies away from challenges and let’s someone else bail him out.   Who wants to hire someone who understands but can’t act?  Being self-aware is half of what it takes to grow and become better; the other half of it is actually acting and practicing on ones faults.   With soccer I always knew I couldn’t trap a ball and while I’m still not really good at it and it was frustrating learning at least now I can catch it. </p>  

<p> So the place I’m stuck at is that I work a lot and the last thing I want to do with my free time is be inside longer.   I also don’t want to just throw away the reason I worked so hard for 4 years, but how am I going to grow and build up my confidence if I can’t build a program?  I need to grow and I realize my faults are my own impatience and frustration with myself.  It took me a while to be okay with this but I have to go along a different route and I have to ask people for help in the meantime.  Hopefully I can return the favor one day.  I have to stop talking and I need to start fighting.  I’ve done a lot of avoidance lately.  My family, and dogs depend on me and I’m really sorry I keep running from everyone.   I kept running from myself, and I kept running from the truth.  The truth was always that I’m still not sure on how to love myself given everything so I just gave in and ran away from my own inadequacy and instead of addressing the dififcult parts about that I ran away and did something else.   It’s been a pain in the ass trying to get to the point where I love myself again but I’m sure accepting that there’s still a lot of time to work on my deficiencies will help that process along.  No one can really make me pick up that pen-paper-keyboard combo and do what needs to be done.  Why did I want to become a software engineer besides the stupid gamble I took that my friends know?  I wanted to help people avoid dying at a young age, I wanted to help kids not throw away their lives because all they know how to do to survive is to cause harm.  I sincerely want to help but to do that I’m going to have to love myself and put myself in a position where I can take care of myself.  I have to stop feeling frustrated at where my life is and just work on what’s bad about it.  Self loathing never solved anything.  I need to address my faults and I need to top stop running from them.  They won't go away because I'm lugging them around with me.  I can't can't escape from my shadow.  I can hide it and make it disappear for a while but it will always be there.</p>

      <h3>  My "Negativity" and Sports </h3>
      <p>  My parents have this hypothesis that the reason I don't have a job yet is because of the way I dress and that I'm hispanic.  A sentiment a lot of cousins share.  I don't want to believe that's true, I want to believe that right now the reason I don't have a job is because I'm lacking in talent and so much that my skin color is brown.  It's the reason I turn away from the news and the world, I want to believe that I'm currently screwed because of my bad decisions and because the day I was born I wasn't born rich and white. </p>

      <p>  I'm not naive don't get me wrong if I was born rich life would have been a lot easier and I'd probably be doing something else with my life, or I might have done better in school.  I just sincerely think that if I spend more time coding and working on my flaws something will come of it.  There's a higher barrier to entry for someone like me, and it felt that way every step of the way through college, but I never wanted to make it a self fulfilling prophecy.  I didn't want to give in to the idea that just because I didn't come from a strong math background I wasn't going to make it, or just because my parents weren't educated I wasn't going to make it.  I wanted to think it was a lot like sports in that if I pushed myself I'd go from being useless to being respected and having the means to express myself through hard work.  I just don't want to blame anyone else but myself for the hole I'm in. I don't want to blame chance or circumstances, I want to blame my lack of talent, and when I try to explain that to people I think they assume I'm just being hard on myself.  As an Athlete who understands that if you're not cutting it you're not cutting and you have to put your head down and work harder, the way I view myself is that I don't practice enough.  How the hell are you going to make any soccer team when you're unfit?  Why is anyone going to hire you when you're clearly out of practice?  Why would I hire you if you get frustrated at yourself.  I have a good friend of mine who took me out to eat at Angeline's and she told me what I wanted to hear, and that it's up to me to make people want me.  I can't blame the coach or in this case the recruiter for not wanting me.  It's my objective to be so good that they can't deny me, and that's the warrior in me.  So when I say I'm not good enough I don't mean it in a negative manner.  I mean it in a way that points out that I haven't put in the hours yet. </p>

      <p>  So to answer my parents hypothesis maybe my skin color is a detterent from people hiring me, I know your skin matters a lot when it comes to whether people will feel safe around you or not.  I think the biggest reason is my lack of practice.  I have to stand out more than everyone and I need to convince myself to put in the work and not get down on mysef.  I sincerely believe that I'm in the rut I'm in because I haven't been taking care of myself.  It's not the worst thing in the world but I need to do my part from here on out, and for the rest of my life.  I have to constantly stay sharp both on and off the field, otherwise I'll never see the field and I'll constantly be struggling </p>
