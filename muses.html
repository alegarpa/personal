      <h3>  My "Negativity" and Sports </h3>
      <p>  My parents have this hypothesis that the reason I don't have a job yet is because of the way I dress and that I'm hispanic.  A sentiment a lot of cousins share.  I don't want to believe that's true, I want to believe that right now the reason I don't have a job is because I'm lacking in talent and so much that my skin color is brown.  It's the reason I turn away from the news and the world, I want to believe that I'm currently screwed because of my bad decisions and because the day I was born I wasn't born rich and white. </p>

      <p>  I'm not naive don't get me wrong if I was born rich life would have been a lot easier and I'd probably be doing something else with my life, or I might have done better in school.  I just sincerely think that if I spend more time coding and working on my flaws something will come of it.  There's a higher barrier to entry for someone like me, and it felt that way every step of the way through college, but I never wanted to make it a self fulfilling prophecy.  I didn't want to give in to the idea that just because I didn't come from a strong math background I wasn't going to make it, or just because my parents weren't educated I wasn't going to make it.  I wanted to think it was a lot like sports in that if I pushed myself I'd go from being useless to being respected and having the means to express myself through hard work.  I just don't want to blame anyone else but myself for the hole I'm in. I don't want to blame chance or circumstances, I want to blame my lack of talent, and when I try to explain that to people I think they assume I'm just being hard on myself.  As an Athlete who understands that if you're not cutting it you're not cutting and you have to put your head down and work harder, the way I view myself is that I don't practice enough.  How the hell are you going to make any soccer team when you're unfit?  Why is anyone going to hire you when you're clearly out of practice?  Why would I hire you if you get frustrated at yourself.  I have a good friend of mine who took me out to eat at Angeline's and she told me what I wanted to hear, and that it's up to me to make people want me.  I can't blame the coach or in this case the recruiter for not wanting me.  It's my objective to be so good that they can't deny me, and that's the warrior in me.  So when I say I'm not good enough I don't mean it in a negative manner.  I mean it in a way that points out that I haven't put in the hours yet. </p>

      <p>  So to answer my parents hypothesis maybe my skin color is a detterent from people hiring me, I know your skin matters a lot when it comes to whether people will feel safe around you or not.  I think the biggest reason is my lack of practice.  I have to stand out more than everyone and I need to convince myself to put in the work and not get down on mysef.  I sincerely believe that I'm in the rut I'm in because I haven't been taking care of myself.  It's not the worst thing in the world but I need to do my part from here on out, and for the rest of my life.  I have to constantly stay sharp both on and off the field, otherwise I'll never see the field and I'll constantly be struggling </p>
