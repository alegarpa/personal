  <h2> Who am I? </h2>
  <div class="post">
    <p> I can't expect a lot of traffic right now and the page is still literally vanilla.  I'll see how things go haha.  I'm not sure what the purpose of this will be long-term.  I should get better at math also hahaha. Maybe make some youtube videos. Etc. Etc.  I just need some direction. </p>

    <p>   My name is Alejandro Garcia-Paredes and I was born and raised in Victorville, CA.  It's a lot different than the Bay  area in that there isn't a lot of water and a lot of people live there because it's cheap.  There isn't much to the town just people trying to scrape by.  A lot like me right now.  Maybe I only know how to struggle and maybe it's not the best thing that I pressure myself so much.  I just feel like my family is counting on me, and I am literaly the only person I know who studied computer science at CAL who doesn't have a job yet.   
    </p>
    <p>
      I graduated from the University of California Berkeley this past August with a degree with Computer Science.  It came with a lot of fighting and I wasn't always sure I was going to finish but I hate quitting and I really wasn't going to let an operating systems class or a compilers class come between me and graduating college. My parents never finished High School and I always had to work 15 hours a week during school, but at the end of the day I figured if I didn't make it those would be excuses and why push yourself so hard without getting a result.  It was a enjoyable experience and I really appreciate being pushed and meeting so many intelligent people, I definetly wouldn't have gotten that back home. I like making programs and I love problem solving, and now that I have time to make that my main focus I'm really content.
